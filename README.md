## 📝 What is this?
A simple but adorable digital clock project where numbers are replaced with neko-chan (catgirl) images. Created "out of boredom", but someone might enjoy it!

## 💡 Features & Improvement Ideas
- Animated GIF digits (to make the catgirls come alive!)
- Potential adaptations for:

  - Browser homepage customization
  - Screensavers

## 🌟 About the Project
NekoClock started as a personal project born from boredom and the desire to recreate something similar - but entirely on my own. While I'm not entirely sure about its practical purpose, I hope someone might find it charming enough to:
- Port to Android/Windows/Linux as widgets
- Use as a decorative element for browser homepages
- Customize with different catgirl assets
